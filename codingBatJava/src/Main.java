     * The point of this file is to run codingBat exercises for activity 1A2 in Data Structures.
     * <p>
     * Instructions:
     * <p>
     * Go to <a href="https://codingbat.com/javaLinks">...</a> to an external site. (you can sign up for an account to save your progress, or just proceed to solving problems).
     * <p>
     * Click on Warmup-1 to view a series of problems that must be solved using java. As you solve each one, you will have a green checkmark indicating success.
     * <p>
     * Solve 2-3 problems other than the one weâ€™ll use as an example.
     * <p>
     * Take a screenshot of your Warmup-1 screen with your checkmarks, and submit that on Canvas to Activity 1B2.
     * <p>
     * I will be doing the following exercises: SleepIn, Diff21, and notString
     * @param args an array of string arguments
