     * Assignment: Task Manager with Singly Linked List
     *
     * Description:
     * You are to implement a simple Task Manager system using a custom singly linked list.
     * Each Task contains an id, a description, and a priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
     * The TaskList class should manage the tasks using a linked list structure.
     *
     * Instructions:
     * 1. Define a Node class to represent a node in the linked list.
     *    - Each node should contain a Task object and a reference to the next node.
     *
     * 2. Implement the following methods in TaskList:
     *
     *    - addTask(Task task)
     *      Inserts a new Task at the end of the linked list.
     *
     *    - removeTaskById(int id)
     *      Removes the first Task with the given id.
     *      Returns true if a task was removed, false otherwise.
     *
     *    - printTasks()
     *      Prints all tasks in the list in order.
     *
     *    - promoteHighPriority()
     *      Moves all HIGH priority tasks to the front of the list while keeping their relative order.
     *
     * 3. In the main method, demonstrate your implementation:
     *    - Add at least three tasks with different priorities.
     *    - Print the tasks.
     *    - Promote HIGH priority tasks and print again.
     *    - Remove one task by id and print again.
     *
     * Deliverables:
     * - A complete Java program with:
     *   - Task class
     *   - Node class
     *   - TaskList class with required methods
     *   - Main method demonstrating functionality
